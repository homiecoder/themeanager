## Further comments

If this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...

## Connection your pull request to an open issue:

Linking a pull request to an issue using a keyword [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

You can link a pull request to an issue by using a supported keyword in the pull request's description or in a commit message. The pull request must be on the default branch.

```
- close
- closes
- closed
- fix
- fixes
- fixed
- resolve
- resolves
- resolved
```

If you use a keyword to reference a pull request comment in another pull request, the pull requests will be linked. Merging the referencing pull request also closes the referenced pull request.

The syntax for closing keywords depends on whether the issue is in the same repository as the pull request.
Linked issue Syntax Examples:

- Issue in the same repository KEYWORD #ISSUE-NUMBER Closes #10
- Issue in a different repository KEYWORD OWNER/REPOSITORY#ISSUE-NUMBER Fixes octo-org/octo-repo#100
- Multiple issues Use full syntax for each issue Resolves #10, resolves #123, resolves octo-org/octo-repo#100

Only manually linked pull requests can be manually unlinked. To unlink an issue that you linked using a keyword, you must edit the pull request description to remove the keyword.

You can also use closing keywords in a commit message. The issue will be closed when you merge the commit into the default branch, but the pull request that contains the commit will not be listed as a linked pull request.
